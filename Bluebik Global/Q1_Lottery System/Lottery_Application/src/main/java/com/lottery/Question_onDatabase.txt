Question-Which Storage will you use for this scenario in the Winner service?
         Storage can be an inbuilt collection(List, Map, Set, Array etc) or a database.

Answer- Based on the scenario and requirements of the Winner service, I used a MySQL database for storage. 

		MySQL is a reliable and widely used relational database management system that can handle large amounts of data, 
		while providing fast and efficient retrieval and storage. It also offers various features for data management and analysis, 
		such as indexing, sorting, and querying.
		
		Using a database provides several advantages over using inbuilt collections such as List, Map, Set, or Array. 
		Databases allow for efficient and scalable data storage, as well as the ability to easily query and manipulate 
		large datasets. Additionally, databases provide data persistence, which means that data can be stored permanently 
		and accessed even after the application or service is shut down.
		
		Overall, using a MySQL database would be the best choice for the Winner service, as it provides a reliable 
		and efficient way to store and manage data.
