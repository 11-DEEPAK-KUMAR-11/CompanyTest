How might user break the code?
Answer-
       1.A user might break the code if they provide input that is not in the expected format 
       Example- if the input is not a valid CSV file.
       
       2.User might also break the code by providing formulas that are too complex or use variables that are not 
         defined. 
         
       To prevent these types of errors, I would include input validation and error handling in the program.
